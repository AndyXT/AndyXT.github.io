# Should You be Worried About Your Security Online?

As of late, I have been going down the rabbit hole of personal security in the context of one's online presence.
And its really amazing how little technical knowledge one needs nowadays to keep one's accounts and identity safe.

## What Options Does the Regular Person Have?

There are Quite a few options available now. I have narrowed it down to **3** categories.

## First, you want to protect your passwords.

The password is your last defense against a cyberattack. It can be what stands between you and identity theft,
the loss of thousands of dollars (*really you could lose it all. even more than what you have.*), ruined credit (debt out of nowhere),
or embarrassing social media posts.

So what exactly makes a strong password? 

There are three criteria you must consider when creating a password. So first of all, there is the obvious (although not so obvious that everyone practices it), you want 
to make your password as complicated as possible (*Length, and a combiniation of numbers, symbols, and mixed cases*), *while still being able to remember it*.
Secondly, you do not want to reuse your password. This will give the would-be attacker access to multiple accounts if he gets ahold
of it. But this leads to the issue of being able to remember the password each time you change it. And Thirdly, you want to change your password over time. 
a password is always only a temporary protection. If someone wants to crack your password, they can brute force,
or if you use a common password, use a dictionary attack. These tactics are simply guessing based on randomness or using a list
of leaked passwords hoping you dont think too differently from others online (this tactic is very effective).

So how does one meet the aforementioned criteria, while keeping track of our passwords?

The solution is a password manager. A password manager is a program that saves all of your passwords for various accounts and can tie into your
mobile device, desktop, and web browser.

## Second, you want to obscure your traffic.

## Third, you want a reliable browser.
